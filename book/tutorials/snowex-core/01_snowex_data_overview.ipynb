    "## Data Coverage\n",
    "Each year we build upon our efforts to further investigate snow remote sensing science gaps identified in the NASA SnowEx Science Plan [(Durand et al., 2016)](https://snow.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/SnowEx_Science_Plan_v1.6.pdf). The summary table lists the focus for each campaign by year and type. There are two different campaign types (IOP vs. TS); both result in the same types of measurements and data products. Depending on the  research application it may not matter at all which you choose to work with, or even combine! The important thing to grasp is the difference in spatial and temporal extent of the campaign periods. If the sampling protocols or data products change over time, it is for the sake of improvement. When possible, we aim to keep things consistent to continue to build a legacy data set. "

This data set can be found at NSIDC and downloaded at multiple resolutions.\n",

    "* SnowEx campaigns are structured based on the objectives set out in the SnowEx Science Plan. Some of those objectives are meet by conducting an all hands-on, short and intense observation period (IOP), while others are addressed by studying the evolution of the snowpack over a much longer time series (TS) style campaign. \n",
