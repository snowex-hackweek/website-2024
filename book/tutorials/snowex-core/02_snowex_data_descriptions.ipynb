    "Campaigns are participant driven and produce community wide data. Without our vast community, we wouldn't have the robust ground-based observations that are part of the SnowEx collection. Discover the ground-based calibration and validation measurements central to the SnowEx field campaigns. Collecting in situ measurements require hours of manual labor and attention to detail. While observers adhere to standard protocols, they often rely on their best judgment and collective expertise when facing challenging sampling conditions."

Field crews marked the Southeast corner and measured square-depths around the 5x5 m perimeter on a 1m interval. Snow depths were collected on a north and west transect of 20 m (15 m addition to the study plot perimeter) or a spiral pattern was used depending on depth instrument availability. The snow pit was excavated in the center of the study plot. SSA measurements were collected inside the ~1x1 m snow pit. SMP measurments were taken at the front of the snow pit and up to 50 m from the snow pit. \n",
