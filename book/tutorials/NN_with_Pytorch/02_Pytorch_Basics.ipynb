    "### What is PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) is a popular open-source deep learning framework known for its flexibility and ease of use. It's widely adopted in both research and industry for tasks ranging from simple machine learning models to complex neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic computation graph: PyTorch's ability to dynamically build the computation graph at runtime makes it intuitive and easy to debug.\n",
    "- Strong community support and integration with Python: PyTorch is Pythonic and integrates well with the Python data science stack.\n",
    "- GPU acceleration: PyTorch makes it easy to move tensors to and from GPUs (supports Apple's Metal and Nvidia GPUs), which is crucial for training large models efficiently.\n",
