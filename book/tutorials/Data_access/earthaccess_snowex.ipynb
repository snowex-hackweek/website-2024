    "# Using `earthaccess` to Search for and Download SnowEx Data from the NSIDC DAAC Server\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to search for and download NSIDC DAAC server hosted SnowEx 2023 data using the `earthaccess` package. SnowEx mission data have not yet migrated to the cloud and continue to be hosted at the NSIDC DAAC server. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example data collection, we use SnowEx23 Mar23 IOP Snow Depth Measurements, Version 1 (Snex23_MAR22_SD) over the Fairbanks, AK, field site. The data are stored in csv format with a metadata-rich header. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use `earthaccess`, an open source package developed by Luis Lopez (NSIDC developer), to allow easy search of the NASA Common Metadata Repository (CMR) and download of NASA data collections.  It can be used for programmatic search and access for both _DAAC-hosted_ and _cloud-hosted_ data. It manages authenticating using Earthdata Login credentials. `earthaccess` can be used to find and access both DAAC-hosted and cloud-hosted data in just **three** lines of code.  See [https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn:  \n",
    "1. how to use `earthaccess` to search for SnowEx data using a spatial filter and explore the search results;  \n",
    "2. how to download data granules to your hub space or local machine.    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow described in this tutorial forms the initial steps of a _Download Model_ workflow that could be run on your local machine or on a AWS cloud compute resource.  You will need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a NASA Earthdata Login.  If you need to register for an Earthdata Login see the [Getting an Earthdata Login](https://icesat-2-2023.hackweek.io/preliminary/checklist/earthdata.html#getting-an-earthdata-login) section of the ICESat-2 Hackweek 2023 Jupyter Book.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Credits\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based on an [NSIDC Data Tutorial](https://github.com/nsidc/NSIDC-Data-Tutorials) originally created by Luis Lopez and Mikala Beig, NSIDC, modified by Andy Barrett, NSIDC, and updated by Jennifer Roebuck and Gail Reckase, NSIDC."

    "[earthacces](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/latest) is a software library that provides an easy to use Python wrapper in front of the CMR and NASA DAAC API's.  Strengths of earthdata include: \n",
    "1. cross-DAAC data access (it's not specific to NSIDC).  \n",
    "2. Access to DAAC server and cloud hosted data. \n",
    "3. Easy authentication handling for Earthdata Login and AWS access keys and token.\n"

The `login` method will automatically search for these credentials as environment variables or in a `.netrc` file, and if those aren't available it will prompt us to enter our username and password. We use a `.netrc` strategy. A `.netrc` file is a text file located in our home directory that contains login information for remote machines.  If we don't have a `.netrc` file, `login` can create one for us.\n",
